📜 Final Patch Note – chess(25)
Release Date: June 25, 2025
Size: ~200MB
Status: Final Version

⚔️ The Journey Ends
After weeks of intense development, sleepless nights, boiling CPUs, and enough keyboard strokes to write a novel, the final patch of this overkill chess project is now complete.

From its first 500KB prototype to a fully optimized 200MB chess engine monster, this project has pushed Java — and myself — to the absolute limit.

🧠 What's New (and Final):
🧩 Added engine selector: Choose between my handcrafted engine or Stockfish.

🧠 AI Power Cap: Difficulty levels now matter. No more accidental GM checkmates on “easy.”

♟️ Move History Export: Now supports PGN format.

🔁 Undo/Redo System polished.

🎨 UI/UX Final Touches: Added theme, cleaner animation, sound effects.

🔧 Stockfish integration finalized (lazy refactor – 60% of the file size, oops).

🪦 Optimization complete – no more performance patches planned.

🪙 Legacy Mode
This version officially ends the patch cycle for this Java project. All future improvements, experiments, and chaos will be carried forward in C-family languages or new platforms.

This repo stands as a tribute to:

How far stubbornness, ego, and curiosity can push a dev.

Java's unexpected durability when absolutely bullied into submission.

And the final boss battle of my second semester.

👋 Final Words
“I rewrote chess.com into chess.exe — and that’s how I closed my second semester.”

Thank you, Java.
You sucked.
But at least you worked.

— Mr. P
